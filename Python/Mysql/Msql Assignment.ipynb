    "**SQL Databases:**\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use SQL for defining and manipulating the data. Here are some key characteristics:\n",
    "- **Structure:** Data is stored in tables, where each table has predefined columns and rows.\n",
    "- **Schema:** They have a predefined schema that specifies the structure of the data.\n",
    "- **Transactions:** They typically support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.\n",
    "- **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL Databases:**\n",
    "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not use SQL for querying data. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. Key features include:\n",
    "- **Structure:** Data can be stored in various formats like key-value pairs, document stores, column-family stores, or graph databases.\n",
    "- **Schema:** They are schema-less or have flexible schema, allowing for easier scalability and adaptation to changing data needs.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** NoSQL databases are generally more scalable horizontally across clusters.\n",
    "- **Examples:** MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",
    "- **Data Structure:** SQL databases store data in tables with a predefined schema, while NoSQL databases use flexible schemas or no schema.\n",
    "- **Query Language:** SQL databases use SQL for querying data, while NoSQL databases use various query languages specific to their data model.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** NoSQL databases are often more scalable horizontally due to their distributed nature.\n",
    "- **Use Cases:** SQL databases are typically used for applications that require complex queries and transactions, while NoSQL databases are preferred for applications with large volumes of data and flexible data models.\n",

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that deals with defining and managing database structures, schema, and constraints. DDL commands are used to define, modify, and delete objects in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the key DDL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE**: The `CREATE` command is used to create new database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and schemas. For example, to create a new table named `employees` in a database:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       emp_name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "       emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command creates a table `employees` with columns `emp_id`, `emp_name`, and `emp_salary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DROP**: The `DROP` command is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, views, indexes, or schemas. For example, to drop the `employees` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command deletes the `employees` table and all its data permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ALTER**: The `ALTER` command is used to modify the structure of existing database objects, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns in a table. For example, to add a new column `emp_address` to the `employees` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "   ADD emp_address VARCHAR(255);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command alters the `employees` table by adding a new column `emp_address`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TRUNCATE**: The `TRUNCATE` command is used to delete all rows from a table, but it retains the table structure and any associated constraints. For example, to remove all data from the `employees` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the key DML commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **INSERT**: The `INSERT` command is used to add new rows of data into a table. It allows you to insert one or more records into a table. For example, to insert a new employee record into the `employees` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary)\n",

    "   This command inserts a new row into the `employees` table with values for `emp_id`, `emp_name`, and `emp_salary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **UPDATE**: The `UPDATE` command is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to update specific columns of existing rows based on a condition. For example, to update the salary of an employee with `emp_id` 1 in the `employees` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   UPDATE employees\n",
    "   SET emp_salary = 55000\n",
    "   WHERE emp_id = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command updates the `emp_salary` column for the employee whose `emp_id` is 1 in the `employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DELETE**: The `DELETE` command is used to remove existing rows from a table based on a condition. It deletes specific rows or all rows if no condition is specified. For example, to delete an employee record with `emp_id` 1 from the `employees` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DELETE FROM employees\n",
    "   WHERE emp_id = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command deletes the row where `emp_id` is 1 from the `employees` table.\n",

    "- `column1, column2, ...`: Specifies the columns from which you want to retrieve data.\n",
    "- `table_name`: Specifies the table from which you want to retrieve data.\n",
    "- `WHERE condition`: Optional clause that specifies conditions that must be met for the rows to be included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a `students` table with columns `student_id`, `student_name`, `age`, and `grade`. To retrieve the names and ages of all students who are 18 years old or older, you can use the following `SELECT` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT student_name, age\n",
    "FROM students\n",
    "WHERE age >= 18;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command retrieves the `student_name` and `age` columns from the `students` table where the `age` is 18 or greater. The result set will include the names and ages of all students who meet this condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `SELECT` statement can include more complex clauses such as `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `JOIN` to customize the results further and perform operations across multiple tables.\n",
    "- It is also possible to use aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) with `SELECT` to compute summaries of data.\n",
    "- `SELECT *` retrieves all columns from the specified table, which is useful when you need all available data about selected rows.\n",
    "\n",

    "- A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each record (row) in a table.\n",

    "- By default, most database systems automatically create a unique index for the primary key column(s).\n",
    "- Example: In a `students` table, `student_id` could be designated as the primary key because each student ID is unique and identifies a specific student record.\n",

    "- The Foreign Key in one table typically points to the Primary Key in another table.\n",
    "- Example: In a `grades` table, `student_id` could be a foreign key that references the `student_id` column in the `students` table. This relationship ensures that a grade record is associated with a valid student record.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",
    "- **Uniqueness**: A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a table, while a Foreign Key establishes a relationship between tables.\n",
    "- **Null Values**: Primary Keys cannot contain NULL values, whereas Foreign Keys can contain NULL values to indicate a lack of relationship.\n",

    "import mysql.connector\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Establishing a connection to MySQL\r\n",

    "# Creating a cursor object using cursor() method\r\n",
    "mycursor = mydb.cursor()\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Explanation of `cursor()` Method\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **cursor()**: The `cursor()` method is used on the database connection object (`mydb` in this case) to create a cursor object. A cursor in this context is a control structure that enables traversal over the records in a database. It allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch data from the result sets.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Explanation of `execute()` Method\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Once you have a cursor object (`mycursor`), you can use its `execute()` method to execute SQL queries:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "# Example of using execute() method\r\n",

    "    print(row)\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **execute(query, params=None)**: The `execute()` method of the cursor object is used to execute an SQL query. It takes one required parameter (`query`), which is a string containing the SQL query to be executed. Optionally, you can also pass parameters (`params`) as a tuple or dictionary if your query uses placeholders (`%s` or `%(name)s`) for parameterized queries.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **fetchall()**: After executing a SELECT query using `execute()`, you can use `fetchall()` to retrieve all rows from the result set as a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a row from the database.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Example of Using `execute()`:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "# Example of inserting data into a table using execute()\r\n",
    "sql_insert = \"INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES (%s, %s)\"\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "print(mycursor.rowcount, \"record inserted.\")\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this example:\r\n",
    "- `sql_insert` is an SQL query with placeholders `%s`.\r\n",
    "- `values` is a tuple containing the values to be inserted into the table.\r\n",
    "- `execute()` is used to execute the `INSERT` query with the provided values.\r\n",
    "- `commit()` is called on the database connection (`mydb`) to commit the transaction and make the changes permanent in the database.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Closing the Connection\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "It's important to close the cursor and the database connection when you're done with them:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "# Closing the cursor and connection\r\n",
    "mycursor.close()\r\n",

    "5. **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to be included in the result set. It retrieves the specified data based on the preceding clauses (`FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **DISTINCT**: Filters duplicate rows from the result set. It ensures that only unique rows are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the rows of the result set based on specified columns and sorting criteria (`ASC` for ascending or `DESC` for descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **LIMIT / OFFSET**: Limits the number of rows returned by the query (`LIMIT`) and optionally specifies an offset from the beginning of the result set (`OFFSET`).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **UNION / INTERSECT / EXCEPT**: Combines result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements. `UNION` combines all distinct rows from multiple queries, `INTERSECT` returns common rows between queries, and `EXCEPT` returns rows from the first query that are not in the second query.\n",
