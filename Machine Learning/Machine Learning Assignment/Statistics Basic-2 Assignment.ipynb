    "A Venn diagram is a graphical tool used to represent the relationships between different sets. It visually displays how sets overlap, intersect, or are mutually exclusive. Venn diagrams use overlapping circles (or other shapes) to show the commonalities and differences between the sets.\n",

    "### Key Components of a Venn Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Circles (or Shapes)**:\n",
    "   - Each circle represents a set or a category.\n",
    "   - The size and position of the circles can indicate the relationship between the sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overlap**:\n",
    "   - The area where circles overlap shows the intersection of the sets, which contains elements common to both (or all) sets.\n",
    "   - If circles do not overlap, the sets are mutually exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Individual Areas**:\n",
    "   - Each circle's non-overlapping area represents the elements unique to that set.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "- **Positive Covariance**: Indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well.\n",
    "- **Negative Covariance**: Indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.\n",

    "Outliers can significantly impact measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation) in a dataset. Here's how outliers affect each measure, along with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean**:\n",
    "   - **Effect**: The mean is highly sensitive to outliers because it is calculated by summing all data points and dividing by the number of points. A single extreme value can pull the mean towards it, distorting the representation of the central value of the data.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Consider the dataset \\[2, 3, 4, 5, 100\\]. The mean is:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Mean} = \\frac{2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 100}{5} = 22.8\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     Here, the outlier (100) skews the mean significantly higher than most of the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median**:\n",
    "   - **Effect**: The median is less affected by outliers because it represents the middle value when the data is sorted. Even if extreme values are present, they do not affect the median unless the number of data points is small or the outliers are numerous.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Using the same dataset \\[2, 3, 4, 5, 100\\], when sorted \\[2, 3, 4, 5, 100\\], the median is:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Median} = 4\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     The median remains stable despite the presence of the outlier (100).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode**:\n",
    "   - **Effect**: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. Outliers typically do not affect the mode unless they are frequent.\n",
    "   - **Example**: For the dataset \\[2, 3, 4, 4, 5\\], the mode is:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Mode} = 4\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     Outliers do not affect the mode unless they are repeated multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures of Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range**:\n",
    "   - **Effect**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Outliers have a significant impact on the range because they affect both the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "   - **Example**: For the dataset \\[2, 3, 4, 5, 100\\], the range is:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Range} = 100 - 2 = 98\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     The outlier (100) increases the range considerably.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variance**:\n",
    "   - **Effect**: Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. Outliers can greatly increase variance because they contribute a large squared deviation from the mean.\n",
    "   - **Example**: For the dataset \\[2, 3, 4, 5, 100\\], first calculate the mean (22.8), then the variance:\n",
    "     \\[\n",

    "     \\]\n",
    "     The outlier (100) causes a significant increase in variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "   - **Effect**: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is also affected by outliers because it incorporates the variance, which is influenced by outliers.\n",
    "   - **Example**: For the dataset \\[2, 3, 4, 5, 100\\], the standard deviation is:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{2123.2} \\approx 46.1\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     The outlier (100) results in a high standard deviation, reflecting the spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Central Tendency**:\n",
    "  - **Mean**: Sensitive to outliers; outliers can skew the mean.\n",
    "  - **Median**: Robust to outliers; provides a better measure of central tendency when outliers are present.\n",
    "  - **Mode**: Less affected by outliers unless the outlier is frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dispersion**:\n",
    "  - **Range**: Highly affected by outliers; a single outlier can greatly increase the range.\n",
    "  - **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Sensitive to outliers; outliers increase the variance and standard deviation due to their squared deviations from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the datasets:\n",
