    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It allows the data to be accessed and modified only through well-defined interfaces (methods), hiding the implementation details from the outside world. Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding and modularity, making the code more maintainable and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows the user to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define a set of methods without providing their implementation. It helps in managing complexity, improving code readability, and promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance:\n",
    "Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class, called the superclass or base class. The class that inherits from the superclass is called the subclass or derived class. Inheritance allows the subclass to reuse and extend the functionality of the superclass, promoting code reuse and modularity. It facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes and promotes polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors based on their context. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass, while method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to coexist in a class. Polymorphism enables flexibility, extensibility, and code reuse.\n",
