    "**Supervised Learning Algorithms** and **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms** are essential for various machine learning tasks. Here is a list of commonly used algorithms for each type:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression**\n",
    "   - Used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.\n",
    "   - Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "   - Used for binary classification problems where the target variable is categorical.\n",
    "   - Example: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decision Trees**\n",
    "   - A tree-like model used for classification and regression tasks. It splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features.\n",
    "   - Example: Predicting whether a customer will churn based on their usage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Random Forest**\n",
    "   - An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "   - Example: Classifying images of handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n",
    "   - Used for classification and regression tasks by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes.\n",
    "   - Example: Classifying different species of flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**\n",
    "   - A non-parametric method used for classification and regression. It predicts the class of a sample based on the classes of its nearest neighbors.\n",
    "   - Example: Recommending products to customers based on their purchase history.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Naive Bayes**\n",
    "   - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between features.\n",
    "   - Example: Text classification, such as sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**\n",
    "   - An ensemble method that builds models sequentially, each one correcting the errors of the previous ones.\n",
    "   - Example: Predicting customer lifetime value.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Neural Networks**\n",
    "   - Computational models inspired by the human brain, used for a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, and time-series prediction.\n",
    "   - Example: Recognizing handwritten characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **K-Means Clustering**\n",
    "   - A method of partitioning the data into k clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.\n",
    "   - Example: Customer segmentation in marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical Clustering**\n",
    "   - Builds a hierarchy of clusters either in a bottom-up or top-down approach.\n",
    "   - Example: Creating taxonomies in biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**\n",
    "   - A clustering method that groups together points that are close to each other based on a distance metric and a minimum number of points.\n",
    "   - Example: Identifying clusters of spatial data in geographical mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**\n",
    "   - A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a set of orthogonal components that capture the most variance.\n",
    "   - Example: Reducing the number of features in image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**\n",
    "   - A technique for reducing high-dimensional data to two or three dimensions for visualization.\n",
    "   - Example: Visualizing clusters of high-dimensional biological data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**\n",
    "   - A computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive, independent components.\n",
    "   - Example: Separating mixed audio signals into individual sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**\n",
    "   - A probabilistic model that assumes the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.\n",
    "   - Example: Modeling the distribution of consumer spending habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Isolation Forest**\n",
    "   - An anomaly detection method that isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.\n",
    "   - Example: Detecting fraudulent transactions in banking.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**\n",
    "   - A type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning that produces a low-dimensional representation of the input space.\n",
    "   - Example: Visualizing high-dimensional data such as gene expression patterns.\n",
