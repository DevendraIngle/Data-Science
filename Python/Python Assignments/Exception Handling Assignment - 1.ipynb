    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. These exceptions can be caught and handled gracefully, allowing the program to recover from unexpected situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences between syntax and error:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax Error**:\n",
    "   - A syntax error occurs when the Python interpreter encounters code that violates the language grammar rules.\n",
    "   - It's detected during the parsing stage (before the code is executed), because the interpreter cannot understand the code due to incorrect syntax.\n",
    "   - Examples of syntax errors include misspelled keywords, missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, etc.\n",
    "   - Syntax errors are generally easier to identify and fix because they are flagged by the interpreter with specific error messages that indicate where the issue occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exception/Error**:\n",
    "   - An exception (or error) occurs when the Python interpreter encounters a situation during runtime that it cannot handle, even though the syntax of the code is correct.\n",
    "   - Unlike syntax errors, exceptions occur during program execution.\n",
    "   - Exceptions can arise due to various reasons such as division by zero, trying to access an index that doesn't exist in a list, attempting to open a non-existent file, etc.\n",
    "   - Exceptions can be anticipated and handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully recover from errors and continue execution.\n",
    "   - Unlike syntax errors, exceptions don't necessarily cause the program to crash immediately; they can be caught and managed, ensuring more robust and fault-tolerant code.\n"
